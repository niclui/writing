Nice to meet you! I am Nicholas, a Statistics MS student and <a href="https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program/scholars/2021/nicholas-lui" title="Knight-Hennessy Scholar">Knight-Hennessy Scholar</a> at Stanford University. I currently work on deep learning problems in climate change under Andrew Ng's <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/">machine learning research group</a>.

For my undergrad, I studied Economics at Cambridge (the best three years of my life). I have worked on anti-competitive behavior detection at <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/capability-centre-dsaid">GovTech</a>, and on ML-driven pricing strategy at <a href="https://go.travelstart.com/lp/about-us">Travelstart</a>. I also developed product strategy at <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/">ByteDance</a> as the first intern (and sixth employee) of its <a href="https://www.byteplus.com/">Global B2B business</a>.

In my free time, I box, run, and watch Netflix (trying to find a new show to binge watch!). I am also a strong advocate for mindfulness, and its value in helping us become kinder to ourselves and others. Here's a <a href="https://self-compassion.org/the-program/">great resource</a> if you are interested.
