Thank you for visiting! I am Nicholas, a Statistics MS student and <a href="https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program/scholars/2021/nicholas-lui" title="Knight-Hennessy Scholar">Knight-Hennessy Scholar</a> at Stanford University. For my undergrad, I studied Economics at Cambridge (the best three years of my life). I have worked on anti-competitive behavior detection at <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/capability-centre-dsaid">GovTech</a>, and on ML-driven pricing strategy at <a href="https://go.travelstart.com/lp/about-us">Travelstart</a>. I also worked on product strategy at ByteDance as the first intern (and sixth employee) of its <a href="https://www.byteplus.com/">Global B2B division</a>.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:niclui@stanford.edu" title="niclui@stanford.edu">niclui@stanford.edu</a> or via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-lui/">LinkedIn</a>. Happy reading!
