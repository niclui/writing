Thank you for visiting! I am Nicholas, a Statistics MS student and <a href="https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program/scholars/2021/nicholas-lui" title="Knight-Hennessy Scholar">Knight-Hennessy Scholar</a> at Stanford University. For my undergrad, I studied Economics at Cambridge (the best three years of my life). I have worked on anti-competitive behavior detection at <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/capability-centre-dsaid">GovTech</a>, and on ML-driven pricing strategy at <a href="https://go.travelstart.com/lp/about-us">Travelstart</a>. I also helped formulate product strategy at ByteDance as the first intern (and sixth employee) of its <a href="https://www.byteplus.com/">Global B2B division</a>.

In my free time, I box, run, and watch Netflix (trying to find a new show to binge watch!). I am also a strong advocate for mindfulness, and its value in helping us become kinder to ourselves and others. Here's a <a href="https://self-compassion.org/the-program/">great resource</a> if you are interested.

If you would like to chat about anything, please drop me a line via <a href="mailto:niclui@stanford.edu" title="niclui@stanford.edu">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-lui/">LinkedIn</a>. Thank you for visiting :)
