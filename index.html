Hi! I am Nicholas, a graduate student at Stanford University. Through this platform, I hope to write about new concepts that I have learnt in the wonderful field of AI (with a focus on deep learning). From medical imaging to recommender systems to protein classification, AI, if used in a responsible manner, can drive massive benefits for humankind. It is thus extremely important for us to understand how these models work, what the potential pitfalls are, and how we can safeguard against them.

I hope to share some important ideas in an **intuitive** and **non-technical** manner, and to reinforce my personal understanding of these concepts. For the latter, I strongly believe that one of the best tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:niclui@stanford.edu" title="niclui@stanford.edu">niclui@stanford.edu</a> or via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-lui/">LinkedIn</a>. I hope you enjoy embarking on this learning journey together with me :)
