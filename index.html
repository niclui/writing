Hi! I am Nicholas, a graduate student at Stanford University. Through this platform, I hope to write about new concepts that I have learnt in the wonderful field of AI. My objective is to make these important ideas intuitive and accessible, and to reinforce my personal understanding of these concepts. For the latter, I strongly believe that one of the best tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:niclui@stanford.edu" title="niclui@stanford.edu">niclui@stanford.edu</a> or via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-lui/">LinkedIn</a>. I hope you enjoy embarking on this learning journey together with me :)
