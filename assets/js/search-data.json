          "content": "AAThank you for visiting! I am Nicholas, a Statistics MS student and Knight-Hennessy Scholar at Stanford University. For my undergrad, I studied Economics at Cambridge (the best three years of my life). I have worked on anti-competitive behavior detection at GovTech, and on ML-driven pricing strategy at Travelstart. I also helped formulate product strategy at ByteDance as the first intern (and sixth employee) of its Global B2B division. . In my free time, I box, run, and watch Netflix (trying to find a new show to binge watch!). I am also a strong advocate for mindfulness, and its value in helping us become kinder to ourselves and others. Here’s a great resource if you are interested. . If you would like to chat about anything, please drop me a line via email or LinkedIn. Thank you for visiting :) . . On the rustic streets of Athens (Dec 2019)",
